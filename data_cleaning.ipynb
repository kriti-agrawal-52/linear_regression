    "# If rows with similar INDUS values also tend to have similar values in other features,\n",

    "\n",
    "# However, this is just a visual hypothesis based on the index — which may have no geographic or \n",

    "# We cannot assume KNN or clustering will work unless we test this properly.\n",

    "# - We would first check individual correlations:\n",

    "# - Even if no individual feature is highly correlated, combinations of features (e.g., TAX + NOX + AGE)\n",
    "#   might form meaningful neighborhoods — which KNN could use.\n",
    "# - To explore this, we would need dimensionality reduction tools like PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP to check \n",
    "#   if similar INDUS values cluster in reduced feature space.\n",
    "# - We could also validate clustering structure using silhouette scores or visual inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Practical limitations with KNN or clustering:\n",
    "# - We must exclude the target variable MEDV to prevent data leakage during imputation.\n",
    "# - We must also exclude CRIM since it has missing values — KNN requires all features to be non-null.\n",
    "# - Not all features are guaranteed to help predict INDUS — including irrelevant ones may add noise.\n",
    "# - Scaling is required since KNN is distance-based.\n",
    "# - Both KNN and clustering require tuning, validation, and extra computation.\n",

    "# Clustering (e.g., KMeans) is another option — group similar rows and impute INDUS with the group’s mean —\n",

    "# Given all this effort — and the fact that INDUS has only 20 missing values — we choose a simple, safe\n",

    "This approach is not perfect, but it's valid — because we're using indirect signals to estimate 'CRIM', rather than CRIM itself.\n",

    "1. K-Means Clustering:\n",
    "   - Groups samples based on contextual patterns.\n",
    "   - Imputes missing 'CRIM' using cluster-level statistics (e.g., mean or median).\n",
    "   - Helps understand the global structure — such as which clusters represent high-CRIM vs low-CRIM areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. KNN Imputation:\n",

    "   - Uses the most similar neighboring rows (based on other features) to estimate missing 'CRIM'.\n",
    "   - Acts as a secondary verification or refinement of the cluster-based estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we use clustering to build broader context, and KNN to refine the local estimate. \n",
